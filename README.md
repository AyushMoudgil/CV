# Amazon-Price-Detection
This is a python script which will detect if the price of a specific item drops below the current selling price on Amazon. 

For example, in the current script I am looking for the price of a wireless earphone to drop to below Rs. 1499. 

Once the price goes down, a mail will be generated claiming that the price has dropped.
